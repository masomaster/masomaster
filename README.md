### Hello World! 👋

I'm really enjoying developing full-stack web apps. I also enjoy researching, publishing, and teaching in the humanities (that *other* world!). I also like love coffee ☕️. Oh, and I'm particularly strange in that I enjoy riding my bike 🚴🏻‍♂️ painfully long distances up painfully long mountains 🏔.
But for things more relevant to coding, check out my repos.
