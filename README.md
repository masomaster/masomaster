# 👋 &nbsp;Hello World!

I’m a highly motivated, detail-oriented software engineer who is addicted to learning and delights in collaborating. I love bringing ideas to pixel-perfect full-stack fruition through innovative solutions to challenging issues. I currently work as a software engineer in higher education, developing back-end solutions for a variety of stakeholders with a special focus on AWS services, Python, and Workday integrations.
