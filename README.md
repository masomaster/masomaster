# Hello World! 👋

I really enjoy developing full-stack web apps that make a difference in the world. 

## A Little More About Me
- I also ~~like~~ **LOVE** coffee ☕️. 
- Oh, and I'm particularly strange in that I enjoy riding my bike 🚴🏻‍♂️ <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/6089368002">painfully long distances</a> up <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4177904179">painfully long mountains</a> 🏔.
- I also enjoy researching, publishing, and teaching in the humanities (that *other* world!). 
- But for things more relevant to coding, check out my repos.
